# Documentation

This folder contains simple static assets used by the documentation site:

- `index.css` — styling for the documentation pages

Primary documentation pages are served from the project root `index.html`.

If you want a richer docs site, consider moving `index.html` into this folder
and adding additional pages such as `getting-started.md`, `api.md`, etc.
